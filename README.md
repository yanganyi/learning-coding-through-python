## Why this repo?

Hi The main reason I created this repository is to showcase what I have achieved in the past 2 years. My father helped me in creating this repository on his github account. He guided me in writing this markdown file.

_This was intially part of a bigger and much older family private repository. The relevant contents were duplicated and moved to this public repository for Hwa Chong EC3 CCA application. - An Yi's father_

## Prior Work
As part of my python learning journey
* I learned the basic operations of python as well as functions and recursions, see the [basic](https://github.com/purplefox81/learning-python-at-home/tree/master/basic) page
* Last year I wrote a math test machine for my younger brother, see the [math-test](https://github.com/purplefox81/learning-python-at-home/tree/master/math-test) page
* With some help from my dad, over the December holiday, I learned how to use python to solve some math problems, see the [math-and-cs](https://github.com/purplefox81/learning-python-at-home/tree/master/math-and-cs) page
* I also learned commonly used data structures in python, namely list and dictionary, see the [data-structure](https://github.com/purplefox81/learning-python-at-home/tree/master/data-structure) page
* Recently my dad challenged me with some algo problems, see the [algo](https://github.com/purplefox81/learning-python-at-home/tree/master/algo) page.
* Besides that, I also created a few simple games like snakes using python (with help from mom of course)


## Achievements

#### Code.org Courses
I complete **all** four courses on Code.org. They are recommended for grades 4-8 students.
* Completed [course 1](https://studio.code.org/s/course1) on code.org
* Completed [course 2](https://studio.code.org/s/course2) on code.org
* Completed [course 3](https://studio.code.org/s/course3) on code.org
* Completed [course 4](https://studio.code.org/s/course4) on code.org  

These courses covers much more topics than Scratch.

#### Coding Game on codecombat.com
I had fun playing the strategy coding game on codecombat.com. I was a [level 23 player](https://codecombat.com/user/yanganyi) on [codecombat](https://codecombat.com). I stopped playing it in Primary 6 to prepare my PSLE.

#### Robotics
I created many robots/machines using lego. I played Xiaomi programmable robot and learned how to use code to control robots' movements.

#### Basic Knowledge
My dad taught me the basic knowledge of
* Hardwares (CPU, hard disk, RAM, I/O)
* Operation System (directory strucutre, basic commands, etc)
* Internet (web, http, etc)
* Event driven programming in robotics and gaming
* Simple time complexity analysis using Big-O notation
